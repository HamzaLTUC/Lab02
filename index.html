    <div class='exp'>
    Specializing in real estate and construction, I’ve amassed 4 years’ experience in office and site work. In the last two years, I was a project manager for two projects. I’m passionate about achieving, planning my work, and fulfill their responsibilities in managing and taking discharges.
    
    Currently, I’m searching out of the box and I’ve enrolled with CodeFellows Software program At  Luminus Technical University College ( LTUC) to widen my horizon and maybe make a brilliant mix between my career and programming .
